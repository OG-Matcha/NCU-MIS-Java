### Problem Statement:

Create a Java program that displays **"Please input:"** on the screen during execution. The user should then input three integers, each separated by a space, using the keyboard. These three integers should be stored in three separate integer variables.

Calculate the average of these three integers, and round the average to two decimal places.

Output the average value, displaying the result in the same format as the example shown below.

## Example:
```
Please input: 
3580 26400 13588
Average: 14522.67
```
