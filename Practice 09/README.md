### Problem Statement:

Design a method that will use recursion to calculate how many character 'A' is in a given string and return it.
'a' is not included in the count, only calculate the number of 'A'. 

## Example:
```
Input a string: COMPUTER SKILLS FOUNDATION
COMPUTER SKILLS FOUNDATION has 1 As
Input a string: java 06
java 06 has 0 As
```
