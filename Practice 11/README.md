## Problem: Inheritance

### Problem Statement:

You need to define three class: Animal, Mammal, Dog.

Each of the class should inherit the previous class as the UML shows. 

And in Main class, construct a Dog object called "gimmy" then print its name.

Change the name to "puppy" then print the name again.
